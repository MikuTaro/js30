## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language used for web development. To improve my skills and deepen my understanding, I have committed to completing the JavaScript30 course by Wes Bos. This course consists of 30 projects that will help me learn vanilla JavaScript by building small, fun applications.

## Goals

- **Learn Vanilla JavaScript**: Enhance my understanding of pure JavaScript without relying on libraries or frameworks.
- **Build Projects**: Complete all 30 projects in the JavaScript30 course to apply my knowledge practically.
- **Daily Commitment**: Dedicate time each day to work on a project and document my progress.
- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**: Develop my problem-solving skills by tackling different coding challenges.
- **Share My Journey**: Document and share my learning journey to help others who are also learning JavaScript.

## Daily Progress

### Day 1: [Project Title]
- **Description**: This day I learn how to create a basic drums by just tapping the keyboard.
- **Key Learnings**: learned some things about JavaScript and how the keyboard works with JavaScript projects and frameworks
- **Challenges**: The removeTransition and learned it with patient attention.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this journey, I have learned a lot about JavaScript, including:

- Core JavaScript concepts and syntax
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- Working with APIs
- Debugging and troubleshooting

## Future Plans

- **Continue Learning**: Keep learning advanced JavaScript topics and frameworks.
- **Build More Projects**: Apply my knowledge by building more complex projects.
- **Contribute to Open Source**: Get involved in open source projects to gain experience and give back to the community.
- **Share Knowledge**: Continue sharing my learning journey and help others who are learning JavaScript.
